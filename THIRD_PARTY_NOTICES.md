## AI Generate Lyrics service (`api/`, `lyravox_ai/`; runs as Python Functions on the same Vercel project)

Only `faster-whisper` is installed (`requirements.txt`); nothing below is vendored in this repository. To the best of our knowledge:
faster-whisper (MIT) with OpenAI Whisper model weights (MIT; downloaded from Hugging Face at run time) and the Silero VAD model it includes (MIT);
its dependencies ctranslate2 (MIT), ONNX Runtime (MIT) and PyAV (BSD-3-Clause), numpy (BSD-3-Clause). The optional Demucs (MIT) / PyTorch (BSD-style) / FFmpeg
(LGPL or GPL depending on the build) are used only on self-hosted installs, never on Vercel. Verify these licenses before redistributing.

## Fonts (not bundled)

The editor and the site load typefaces at runtime from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/); no font files are included
in this repository, and the browser sends an ordinary web request to Google when a font is needed. The families are
distributed through Google Fonts under open-source font licenses (predominantly the SIL Open Font License 1.1; check each
family's page before redistributing the font files themselves):

- Site and interface: Inter, JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, IBM Plex Sans JP.
- Japanese: Noto Sans JP, Noto Serif JP, Dela Gothic One, Zen Kaku Gothic New, Zen Old Mincho, Kaisei Tokumin,
  M PLUS Rounded 1c, Mochiy Pop One, DotGothic16, Yuji Syuku (and the other Japanese faces listed in src/02_fonts.js).
- Bangla (added by LYRAVOX): Noto Sans Bengali, Noto Serif Bengali, Hind Siliguri, Baloo Da 2, Tiro Bangla, Galada, Atma, Mina.
- Chinese and Korean faces used by those editions are listed in src/02b_lang.js.

Fonts that a user loads from their own device stay on that device and remain under their own licenses.
